### Test Bench syntax

[source,vhdl]
----
entity testbench_ent is
  <entity definition>              // <1>
end entity testbench_ent;

architecture testbench_arch of testbench_ent is    // <2>

  <signal declarations>

  <component declarations>

begin

  <component instantiations>

  <stimuli (test vectors)>   // <3>
  
end architecture testbench_arch;
----
<1> What is entity is defined in other design file? => leave blank BUT must be declared.
<2> Note the architecture name, not behaviour, rtl or structural
<3> All the simulation results are reported using the *assert* and *report* statements.

.syntax.assert
[source,vhdl]
----
assert condition report string severity severity_level;

.test_bench.vhdl

<1> signals requires no ip/ops. They are just connecting wires. Could be declared in same line (including vectors).
<2> Note the usage of *after* keyword for assigning values based on time intervals
