== Tools

1. https://ghdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[GHDL is an open-source simulator for the VHDL language]. GHDL allows you to compile and execute your VHDL code directly in your PC.
2. GTKWave

=== A quickstart to GHDL and GTKWave

0. It is assumed that the design and testbench are created at this point.
1. Launch a console window
2. Navigate to the directory containing the design and testbench
3. Compile and simulate the design with GHDL
----
ghdl -s some_design.vhd testbench.vhd to check the syntax. This step step is optional.
ghdl -a some_design.vhd testbench.vhd to analyze the design.
ghdl -e testbench_entity_name to build an executable for the testbench.
ghdl -r testbench_entity_name --vcd=file_name.vcd to simulate the design and dump the waveform to a file.
----
4. Examine the waveform with GTKWave
----
gtkwave file_name.vcd to launch GTKWave
